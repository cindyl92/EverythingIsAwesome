===================
Instructions:

How to run our project:
Our project runs best when loaded into the Unity software. To do so, install Unity, and open our project (the repository is the root directory for the project). From there, you can click on the Play button in the upper middle part of the window, and the application will run. 

Dependencies:
The user enters a repo name, which runs the Decomposer.js script. After the files have been written, it will call the BuildingHeights.cs which will call JSONParser.cs and CustomParser.cs to get the data needed to produce the visualization.

Where to find the code:
The code files we wrote can be found under CodeCity -> Assets -> Scripts
The architectural table in the writeup will map the correct class to each component.

Testing Frameworks:
All the testing information can be found in the README file inside the Tests folder. The unit tests, instructions for integration testing, and sample text files are also in that folder.

Thanks and we hope you enjoy Code City!
